This is the first release of the RepRap-XY printer. It is based on the excellent design of Zelogic.
See the thread in the RepRap forum: http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?4,297740

When I saw this printer I thought, this is the printer I want. It only has one problem for me, it is made from CNC-ed aluminium. I decided to build a printer based on this design, but use printed parts instead of aluminium parts.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS - IT IS NOT YET FINISHED.
Use at your own risk.

The file src/core-XY.FCStd is the complete assembly in FreeCAD format.
The file src/core-XY.vc3 is the complete assembly in VIACAD format.

For now the STL folder is empty, to prevent people to start printing before checking the design.

Have fun.
